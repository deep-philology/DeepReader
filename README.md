# DeepReader

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/deep-reader/DeepReader](https://badges.gitter.im/deep-reader/DeepReader.svg)](https://gitter.im/deep-reader/DeepReader?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

DeepReader is a highly modular, Vue.js-based framework designed for building online reading environments for deep reading of texts with rich annotations and integrated learning tools.

It is particulary intended for the study of classical languages such as Ancient Greek but could be applied to any texts with rich annotations. What is here is an early prototype using the MorphGNT API and the CTS protocol but we plan to support other text services as well including EPUB.

Reading environments built with the DeepReader framework could be as simple as Kindle-like apps but the real intention is to support deep reading with integrated dictionaries, linguistic annotations, and commentaries, as well as learning tools such as vocabulary flashcards and parsing drills.

Each widget is a separate Vue.js component. We are working to make it as simple as possible to develop new widgets that interact and engage with the current passage, optionally calling out to external APIs.

We are also experimenting with Firebase for persistence. Offline use is also planned as is packaging DeepReader up as an app for mobile use.

## Dependencies

DeepReader requires Node 8.

## Setup

To run DeepReader in development mode, clone this repo then:

    npm install
    npm run dev

Presently, there are two readers accessible at these paths:

* CTS: http://localhost:5066/#/cts
* MorphGNT: http://localhost:5066/#/morphgnt

If you hover over the reader, you'll see various pluggable widgets on the left and right. Those on the left are used to choose what passage to read, and those on the right are used to present additional information about the passage and its individual words, and to control the appearance of the passage.

You can expand or collapse any widget by clicking on its title. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to pagination between passages in a work.
